# This is my Coding-Quiz

Upon beginning the quiz, a timer of 60 seconds is supposed to begin. 

Timer is not functional.  Even with the help of a tutor, I could not get this working, let alone get a penalty applied to the timer on wrong answers.

High-scores page not functional. My GitHub pushing issues took up first half of tutor session and could only cover so much.

Once I obtain further knowledge, I will come back to resubmit if/when I find myself with extra time to do so.

If not, I am going to count this project out as one of my two lowest scores.
